<h2 align="center"><b>About the Project</b></h4>

<p>Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day.</p>

<hr />

<h4><u>User Story</u></h4>

    - AS AN employee with a busy schedule
    I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
    SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

<h4><u>Acceptance Criteria</u></h4>

<p><b>GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule</b></p>

      - #1: WHEN I open the planner
            THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

      - #2: WHEN I scroll down
            THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours

      - #3: WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
            THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

      - #4: WHEN I click into a time block
            THEN I can enter an event

      - #5: WHEN I click the save button for that time block
            THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

      - #6: WHEN I refresh the page
            THEN the saved events persist
